I apologize for the messy layout, I'm kinda struggling with version conflicts as I started working on the physics engine and then had to go back and I do not understand git well enough for any of this.

The `Options` and `Play` buttons on the main menu currently do nothing because I don't know if I have time to implement settings so I'm leaving that door open, and I obviously don't have the game coded yet as I don't even have physics yet.

The file names might be a bit weird because I did not want to deal with transferring all of my folder structure over into p5js so I made a bash (Linux scripting language essentially) script to make a copy of every file sorta with the folders intact so I apologize about that.

I also either did or will rework the buttons into being in the global register and have the p5js function: `mousePressed` handle looping through the button register. But, I either did not have time or simply didn't want the hassle at the time of doing that, but, I will work on redoing that.

If there are any other problems with my code blame it on git /hj
